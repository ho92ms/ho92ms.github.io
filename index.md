## About Me

I am a **software engineer** and **machine learning researcher** with a background in enterprise-scale systems and applied computational methods.

My work focuses on the intersection of:
- **rigorous system design** � building reliable, maintainable architectures,
- **applied machine learning** � data-driven models with clear theoretical foundations,
- **mathematical structure** � preferring solutions that are conceptually simple and empirically verifiable.

I value approaches that balance **theoretical elegance** with **practical constraints**, and I am particularly interested in problems where formal methods meet real-world complexity.
