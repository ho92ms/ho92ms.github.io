I work as a research-oriented software engineer at the intersection of **enterprise systems** and **applied machine learning**
with a strong emphasis on operations and automation.

My focus is on building systems that are:
- **reliable** (operable, secure, observable),
- **measurable** (clear metrics and testable claims),
- and **maintainable** over time.

Use the menu to navigate to **About**, **Research**, **Experience**, and **CV**.
