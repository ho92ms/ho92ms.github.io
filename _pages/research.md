My interests are centered around applied machine learning and system-level engineering.

Key topics include:
- representation learning and neural networks,
- large language models,
- data-driven modeling,
- performance and scalability of complex systems.

I am especially interested in approaches that emphasize structure, interpretability,
and reproducibility over ad-hoc optimization.
