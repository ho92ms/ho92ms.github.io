I am a software engineer with a background in enterprise-scale systems and applied machine learning.

My work focuses on building reliable, maintainable, and interpretable systems.
I am particularly interested in problems where theoretical structure and practical constraints meet.

I prefer solutions that are:
- conceptually simple,
- mathematically well-founded,
- and empirically verifiable.
