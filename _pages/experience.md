## Overview

My professional background spans **enterprise IT systems**, **software engineering**, and **applied machine learning**. I have experience leading technical teams, designing scalable architectures, and implementing data-driven solutions.

---

## 1. Enterprise Systems & Infrastructure

### Cloud & Virtualization
- **Azure cloud platform** — resource management, security, and compliance.
- **Virtualization technologies** — Hyper-V, VMware, containerization (Docker).
- **Infrastructure automation** — infrastructure-as-code (IaC) with Terraform and ARM templates.

### Endpoint Management
- **Windows environments** — Active Directory, Group Policy, SCCM/Intune.
- **Linux systems** — server administration, shell scripting, configuration management.
- **Security & compliance** — endpoint protection, vulnerability management, audit workflows.

### DevOps & Automation
- **CI/CD pipelines** — Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring & logging** — centralized log management, performance metrics.
- **Scripting & automation** — PowerShell, Bash, Python for operational tasks.

## 2. Software Engineering

### Backend Development
- **RESTful APIs** — designing scalable, versioned endpoints.
- **Database systems** — SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB).
- **Microservices** — distributed architectures, service orchestration.

### Development Practices
- **Version control** — Git workflows, branching strategies, code review.
- **Testing** — unit tests, integration tests, test-driven development (TDD).
- **Documentation** — technical writing, API documentation, architecture diagrams.

### Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- **Frameworks:** Flask, FastAPI, Spring Boot, .NET.
- **Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Postman, Swagger.

## 3. Machine Learning & Data Science

### Applied Neural Networks
- **Deep learning frameworks** — PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model development** — training, validation, hyperparameter tuning.
- **Deployment** — serving models via REST APIs, containerized inference.

### Data Analysis
- **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** — statistical summaries, visualizations.
- **Feature engineering** — domain-specific transformations and representations.
- **Experimentation** — A/B testing, statistical validation, reproducible research.

### LLM-Based Systems
- **Prompt engineering** — optimizing inputs for large language models.
- **Fine-tuning** — domain adaptation with LoRA, prefix tuning.
- **System integration** — building LLM-powered applications with error handling and monitoring.

---

## 4. Leadership & Collaboration

- **Technical leadership** — guiding teams through system migrations and architectural decisions.
- **Cross-functional collaboration** — working with product, security, and operations teams.
- **Mentorship** — onboarding junior engineers, code reviews, knowledge sharing.

---

## Key Strengths

1. **Bridging theory and practice** — applying formal methods to real-world systems.
2. **End-to-end ownership** — from design and implementation to deployment and monitoring.
3. **Systematic problem-solving** — breaking down complex challenges into manageable components.
