## Overview

I work at the intersection of **systems architecture**, **software engineering**, **DevOps**, and **applied AI**.

My focus is on building and operating **reliable, secure, and automated enterprise-scale systems**, and on integrating AI-driven components into real-world operational environments.

---

## Enterprise Systems & Infrastructure

- Design and operation of **centralized Active Directory–based infrastructures**
- Domain Controller, DNS, and DHCP integration
- Policy-based configuration and enforcement (Group Policy)
- Foundations for centralized client and server management

---

## Security Engineering

- Endpoint protection and system hardening
- Policy-driven security enforcement and configuration validation
- Backup architecture design and operation
- Secure access patterns for externally deployed systems

---

## Automation & DevOps

- Automated, zero-touch provisioning workflows for heterogeneous environments
- Centralized software distribution and lifecycle management
- Scripted automation for internal services and production systems
- Virtualized server and desktop environments

---

## Software Engineering & Applied AI

- Development of OCR-based document processing systems with fuzzy logic
- Integration of AI-driven components into production software
- Python-based AI/LLM experimentation (NLP, Hugging Face models)
- Internal LLM prototype for domain-specific knowledge retrieval
- Ongoing work toward GPU-accelerated inference
