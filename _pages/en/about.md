I am a research-oriented software engineer working at the intersection of **enterprise systems** and **applied machine learning**.

My work focuses on:
- **reliable system design** (operability, security, automation),
- **data-driven methods** (modeling, evaluation, reproducibility),
- and engineering decisions that remain valid under practical constraints.

I prefer solutions that are:
- **explicit about assumptions**,
- **measurable** (clear metrics and testable claims),
- and **maintainable** in production environments.

**Current interests:** ML/LLMs in operational settings, automated compliance and monitoring, and system-level optimization.
