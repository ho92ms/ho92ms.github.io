## Research Focus

My research interests lie at the intersection of **enterprise-scale systems**, **security operations**, and **applied machine learning**, with particular emphasis on approaches that remain valid under real-world operational constraints.

Rather than isolated model performance, I focus on **system-level behavior**, **measurable impact**, and **controlled deployment** of AI-assisted solutions.

## Core Research Directions

### 1. LLMs for Operational and Security Data

- Application of large language models to **log analysis**, **event correlation**, and **incident interpretation**
- Investigation of **hallucination risk**, reliability, and failure modes in operational environments
- Human-in-the-loop workflows for security and system operations
- Evaluation methodologies for LLM-assisted decision support systems

---

### 2. AI-Assisted Infrastructure and Policy Analysis

- Mapping infrastructure and security policies to **machine-interpretable representations**
- Automated detection of configuration drift and compliance violations
- Combining rule-based enforcement with data-driven anomaly detection
- Auditability and reproducibility of policy evaluation pipelines

---

### 3. System Foundations for AI-Enabled and Agentic Systems

- Designing system constraints that enable **safe agent behavior**
- Secure communication and execution boundaries
- Observability and rollback in partially autonomous systems
- Cost-aware and failure-aware deployment strategies

## Methodological Principles

1. **Operational realism** — research questions grounded in real deployment constraints  
2. **Empirical validation** — metric-driven evaluation over anecdotal success  
3. **Human oversight** — AI as decision support, not opaque automation  
4. **Reproducibility** — experiments and results must be repeatable

## Current Exploratory Work

- LLM-assisted internal knowledge systems for enterprise software support  
- Automated analysis of security and system events using hybrid rule-based and ML approaches  
- Evaluation of lightweight agent architectures for operational monitoring
