- **Components:** Mock OPC server, tunnel client, relay server with concurrent connection management
- **Impact:** Enabled secure remote monitoring without VPN overhead

### 2. Enterprise Security Hardening Framework
*Automated Windows compliance and threat detection*

- **Scope:** 100+ enterprise workstations and servers
- **Methods:** GPO-based STIG implementation, ASR rules, honeypot deployment
- **Tools:** HardeningKitty, Wazuh SIEM, custom PowerShell scripts
- **Results:** Reduced attack surface, real-time ransomware detection, compliance audit readiness

### 3. PXE Boot Infrastructure
