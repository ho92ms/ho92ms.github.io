## Overview

The site serves as a professional profile with emphasis on:
- **Software engineering** — DevOps, backend development
- **Applied machine learning** — neural networks, LLMs, interpretable AI
- **Academic rigor** — mathematically grounded, empirically verifiable solutions under real-world system constraints

---

## Structure

The website is organized into the following sections:

- **[Home](https://ho92ms.github.io/)** — introduction and professional summary

## Philosophy

> *"Conceptually simple. Mathematically grounded. Empirically verifiable."*

I prefer solutions that balance theoretical elegance with practical constraints, emphasizing:
1. **Structure** over ad-hoc optimization
2. **Reproducibility** and transparency
3. **Interpretability** in complex systems
