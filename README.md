# Németh Dávid — Academic Pages

This repository hosts the source code of my personal academic website, built using the
[Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template
and deployed via GitHub Pages.

The site serves as a concise professional profile with emphasis on
software engineering, system-level thinking, and applied machine learning.

## Focus

My interests lie at the intersection of:

- large-scale and enterprise systems,
- automation and DevOps practices,
- applied machine learning,
- and structurally interpretable models.

I prefer solutions that are conceptually simple, mathematically grounded,
and empirically verifiable.

## Structure

The website is organized into the following sections:

- **About** — short professional summary
- **Research** — research and technical interests
- **Experience** — selected professional domains
- **CV** — condensed curriculum vitae
- **Contact** — professional contact information

## Technology

- Jekyll (GitHub Pages)
- Markdown-based content
- Static site generation
- Minimal dependencies
